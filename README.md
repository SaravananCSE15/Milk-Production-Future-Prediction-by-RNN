#Milk production forecasting plays a crucial role in dairy industry management, facilitating better planning of resources and operations. 
In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for milk production prediction.
RNNs are well-suited for modeling sequential data, making them ideal for capturing the temporal dependencies inherent in milk production time series. 
The results indicate that our RNN-based approach offers promising results for accurate and reliable milk production prediction, 
thereby assisting dairy farmers and stakeholders in making informed decisions to optimize production efficiency and profitability.
